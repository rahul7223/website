    The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct
     from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.<br><br>

Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made 
in Edgar Allan Poe's essay "The Philosophy of Composition" (1846).[1] According to William Faulkner, a short story is character driven and a writer's job is to "...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil
 trying to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.‚Äù[2]

Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form. Somerset Maugham thought that the short story "must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words,
 it must have a plot". <br><br>
This view is however opposed by Anton Chekov who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end. It should just be a "slice of life", presented 
suggestively.<br> Sukumar Azhikode defined a short story as" a brief prose narrative with an intense episodic or anecdotal effect".[4] Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the
 form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.[3]

Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognized in modern society
 for hundreds of years.<br>

As William Boyd, the award-winning British author and short story writer has said:

[short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if,
 for the duration of its telling, something special
  been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated, some 
  temporary sense has been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the
   grave and oblivion.
