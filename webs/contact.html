<h1 id="haddi">Qualities that Makes a Company a Great Place to Work:</h1>
Some of the things which help or create a positive environment among employees and the employers are listed below.

It is necessary to understand what makes your company a great place to work and how to make your company better.
<h2 id="haddi">1. Keep encouraging people:</h2>
It is very necessary to make an employer feel good about his / her working environment and to make that happen an employer need to start encouraging employees of his / her office so that they can work in a better manner.

Therefore, it is very much necessary to encourage the employees of the company, through some kind of professional encouragement such as promotions or performance appreciation. All these things help an employee feel better or great in a company.
<h2 id="haddi">2. Learn from others:</h2>
A company is where all the employees and their employers work together and deliver their duties with responsibility. It is possible that these deliveries of duties will be benefited if they try to learn something from each other.

There may be some kind of situation when an employer might have acted maturely to handle such a crucial situation and these all incidents can help an employee learn from his / her employer for a better future.
<h2 id="haddi">3. Create a healthy competition:</h2>
Working in a great environment may take some kind of positivity among employees and employers, but actually, the truth is that this can happen by some kind of healthy competition among these employers and their employees<strong> to perform better in their duties.</strong></br>

There may be a possibility that these competitions can be brought in, to set an achievable target for the financial year-end competition. This kind of competition is commonly held in the marketing or sales department for some kind of encouragement.
 <h2>4. Communicate with other departments:</h2>
There is a common kind of mistake that most of the employees deliver while they are working in the office.

For example, an employee only communicates with his / her fellow department staff and never tries to communicate with other department staff. This kind of behavior can make things very limited for that particular employee.

Therefore, if an employee tries to mingle or communicate with other staff members of the office, then there is a possibility that an employee ends up having many fellow employees in the company.

<h2>5. Actively participate in events or volunteer programs:</h2>
There are some of the companies that conduct some kind of fun acts or events in the office on the occasion of various functions.
 And it will be advisable if all the employees of the company take part in such events either as participants or as volunteers for the successful completion.

Therefore, all these kinds of efforts can create an environment which will be favourable for all the employees of the company to feel better in their company.

<h2>6. Respect your subordinates:</h2>
If an employer or an employee needs to feel good in their company then there is a simple thing which they can perform for the healthiest relationship with their company.

There may be a possibility that an employer who is a junior starts disrespecting a senior employee for some reason and that builds some kind of negativity for both the employees of the company.

Therefore, to avoid such tension between employees, an employer needs to communicate with them to resolve problems and create a healthy start for their own good.
